  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><em>Last updated: 2025</em></p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how Nexo.corp ("we", "our", "us") collects,
    uses and protects information in connection with the XO AI tool and this
    website ("Services").
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
  <p>Depending on how you use the Services, we may collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Usage data</strong> — basic technical information such as
      browser type, approximate region, and pages visited. This is typically
      collected in aggregated form to understand how the Services are used.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Chat input</strong> — the text you type into XO AI, which is
      processed by the model in order to generate responses.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Contact information</strong> — only if you choose to contact us
      directly and provide an email or other details.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How we use information</h2>
  <p>We may use the information above to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and operate XO AI and other tools</li>
    <li>Monitor basic usage and performance</li>
    <li>Improve features, safety and reliability</li>
    <li>Respond to support or feedback messages</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data storage and third-party services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      XO AI relies on third-party model providers and hosting platforms. Your
      prompts and responses may be processed by those providers in order to
      generate answers and keep the service running.
    </li>
    <li>
      We do not sell your personal data to third parties.
    </li>
    <li>
      We generally aim to keep only the minimum data needed to operate and
      improve the Services.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Cookies and analytics</h2>
  <p>
    The website may use basic cookies or analytics tools to understand overall
    traffic and usage patterns. This helps us see which pages are useful and
    where the experience can be improved.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Your choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You can choose not to provide optional information. If you do not agree
      with this policy, please do not use the Services.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you contact us and later want us to delete your messages, you can
      request removal where possible.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Children</h2>
  <p>
    The Services are not specifically targeted at children under 13.
    If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided
    personal information, please contact us so we can review and, where
    appropriate, remove the data.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will
    update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of
    the Services after changes are posted means you accept the revised policy.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Contact</h2>
  <p>
    If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can reach us using
    the contact information provided on the main website.
