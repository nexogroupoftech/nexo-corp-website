  <p>
    These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Nexo.corp website,
    XO AI, and any other tools or services provided through this site
    (collectively, the "Services").
    By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
    If you do not agree, please do not use the Services.
  </p>

      these Terms.

  <h2>2. Accounts and Access</h2>
  <p>
    In most cases you can use XO AI without creating an account. If any part of
    the Services later requires an account, you are responsible for maintaining
    the confidentiality of your login information and for all activity under
    your account.
  </p>

  <h2>3. AI-Generated Content</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      XO AI generates responses using large language models. These responses may
      be inaccurate, incomplete or outdated.
    </li>
    <li>
      You are responsible for how you use any information or suggestions
      generated by XO AI. Always double-check important facts or decisions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Nexo.corp is not liable for any loss or harm resulting from reliance on
      AI-generated content.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The design, logo, text and code of this website and the Services are

      You may not copy, modify, distribute or resell the Services without prior
      written permission.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    XO AI and other tools may depend on external APIs or platforms (for example,

    To the maximum extent permitted by law, Nexo.corp will not be liable for
    any indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages arising out of
    or in connection with your use of the Services.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Changes to the Services and Terms</h2>
  <p>
    We may update or change the Services at any time, including adding or
    removing features. We may also update these Terms from time to time.
    Continued use of the Services after changes are posted means you accept the
    revised Terms.
