  <h1>About Nexo.corp</h1>

  <p>
    Nexo.corp is a small, independent studio focused on building clean,
    practical and intelligent tools powered by AI. We care about clarity,
    usefulness and design more than buzzwords.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our first public project is <strong>XO AI</strong> — a calm, professional
    assistant designed to help with study, problem solving, planning and daily
    life. Over time, we aim to grow a full ecosystem of tools that make
    knowledge and productivity easier for everyone.
  </p>

  <h2>Founder</h2>
  <p>
    Nexo.corp was founded by <strong>Dev</strong>, a student and self-taught
    builder who enjoys combining technology, design and psychology.
    The goal is simple: create products that feel respectful, focused and
    genuinely helpful.
  </p>

  <h2>What we value</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Clarity</strong> — No fake hype. Just clear communication.</li>
    <li><strong>Respect</strong> — Tools that support people, not replace them.</li>
    <li><strong>Privacy</strong> — Minimal data collection, no selling of data.</li>
    <li><strong>Learning</strong> — We improve the products based on feedback.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This website and the tools hosted here are still early-stage experiments.
    Features may change frequently as we test, learn and improve.
