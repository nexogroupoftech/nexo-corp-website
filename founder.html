<h1>Founder</h1>
<h2>Devk</h2>

<p>
NexoCorp was founded with a clear intent: build technology that respects intelligence,
time, and long-term thinking.
</p>

<p>
The studio operates with restraint, focus, and personal ownership.
There is no rush to scale—only a commitment to quality and clarity.
</p>

<p>
DarkFury and other systems are developed under a single vision:
calm tools for serious thinkers.
